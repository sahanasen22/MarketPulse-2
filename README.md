# MarketPulse AI  
### Intelligent Real-Time Digital Asset Market Analysis System

---

## Abstract

MarketPulse AI is an advanced analytics platform designed to bridge the gap between volatile digital asset markets and human interpretation. The system integrates real-time cryptocurrency market data with global news streams to provide a comprehensive analytical framework for market understanding.

By combining structured numerical price metrics with unstructured news sentiment, MarketPulse AI delivers context-aware market summaries that explain underlying price movements. The platform incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama 3.3 and Gemini, alongside Natural Language Processing techniques to generate intelligent, interpretable insights for retail investors.

The final system is presented as an interactive dashboard featuring live charts, sentiment indicators, and an AI-powered chatbot capable of answering personalized market queries. This approach significantly reduces information overload and improves analytical efficiency in highly volatile environments.
